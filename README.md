# This flask-url-shortener application takes a website URL or a file (specified by the user) and create a short name for that link, based on a name chosen by the user.

Each shortname along with the URL or file it represents is saved into a urls.json file, which gets updated as more data is entered. 

Application needed for this to work:
1. pytest for testing 
2. werkzeug for secure file utility
3. GUNICORN
4. Flask (obvious)
